# good-night-ml
This project is about sending good night messages just before your loved one(s) goes to sleep, by predicting the time based on the Telegram accesses timestamps and/or last seen time.

## Why this project?
I started this for fun some time ago. After moving to Korea, I and a girl I had a (sort of) relationship with decided to just be friends due to the distance and not to send each other sweet things like the good night message. Since I didn't want to break the deal, I thought: _"Why not let an AI send the good night? She will receive it and I technically wasn't the one sending it!"_
So, here is how the idea was born. Nothing too complex, just an algorithm collecting the access timestamps, detecting the time when she goes to sleep and wake up, make some inferences with machine learning about tomorrow's time to go to bed, send a message just before that and... voil√†! As you can imagine, it took me some time to figure out all the details of this project, but at the end it is kind of working. Was it something really useful? Probably not. But who cares, it was fun!
